# Mini-Search-Engine
As we know the title itself describes that itâ€™s a searching-based program and have to implement it by linked list approach. Our task is to design and implement an algorithm that searches a collection of documents. We will be provided with a set of 50 documents and a set of sample queries. You have the freedom to select the data structures and algorithms that you consider to be more efficient for this task. Of course, we will have to justify your decisions. In our approach we have to undergo two modules.1) Indexing Access the data by saving their contents like words/tokens in the data structure we selected and have to access the file by storing keywords.2) Retrieval In this module we have to search for the key words which stored in the documents by using operators.
